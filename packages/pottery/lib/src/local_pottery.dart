///
/// {@template localPottery.class}
/// This widget defines new factories for existing pots and binds the
/// objects created by them to the pots so that those objects are made
/// available to descendants.
///
/// An important fact is that the factories of the existing pots are
/// not actually replaced, therefore calling the [Pot.call] method
/// still returns the object held in the global pot. Use [NearestPotOf.of]
/// instead to obtain the local object from the nearest `LocalPottery`
/// ancestor. The example below illustrates the behaviour.
///
/// ```dart
/// final fooPot = Pot(() => Foo(111));
///
/// ...
///
/// class ParentWidget extends StatelessWidget {
///   @override
///   Widget build(BuildContext context) {
///     return LocalPottery(
///       pots: {
///         fooPot: () => Foo(222),
///       },
///       builder: (context) {
///         print(fooPot()); // 111
///         print(fooPot.of(context)); // 222
///
///         return ChildWidget();
///       },
///     );
///   }
/// }
///
/// class ChildWidget extends StatelessWidget {
///   @override
///   Widget build(BuildContext context) {
///     print(fooPot()); // 111
///     print(fooPot.of(context)); // 222
///     ...
///   }
/// }
/// ```
///
/// This is useful when you need in descendants some objects that are
/// different from the ones held in global pots but of the same type.
///
/// In the following example, a `LocalPottery` provides its descendant
/// (TodoListPage) with a notifier for a specific category. It allows
/// the previous page to control which category the next page is
/// associated with.
///
/// ```dart
/// Navigator.of(context).push(
///   TodoListPage.route(category: Category.housework),
/// );
///
/// ...
///
/// class TodoListPage extends StatelessWidget {
///   const TodoListPage._();
///
///   static Route<void> route({required Category category}) {
///     return MaterialPageRoute(
///       builder: (context) => LocalPottery(
///         pots: {
///           todosNotifierPot: () => TodosNotifierPot(category: category),
///         },
///         builder: (context) => const TodoListPage(),
///       ),
///     );
///   }
///
///   @override
///   Widget build(BuildContext context) {
///     // This is a notifier for a list of a specific category.
///     final notifier = todosNotifierPot.of(context);
///
///     return ValueListenableBuilder(
///       valueListenable: notifier,
///       builder: (context, state, child) {
///         return Scaffold(
///           appBar: AppBar(
///             // The title is "Housework" if the current
///             // notifier is for the category of housework.
///             title: Text(state.category.label),
///           ),
///           ...
///         );
///       },
///     );
///   }
/// }
/// ```
///
/// Note that there are several important differences between
/// `LocalPottery` and [Pottery]:
///
/// * `LocalPottery` creates an object immediately, whereas
///   `Pottery` creates (replaces, more precisely) an object only
///   if the relevant Pot already have one.
/// * As already mentioned, objects created by `LocalPottery` are
///   only accessible with [NearestPotOf.of].
/// * Objects created by `LocalPottery` are not automatically
///   discarded when the `LocalPottery` is removed from the tree.
///   Use [disposer] to do clean-up.
///
/// Also note that an error arises only at runtime if the map
/// contains wrong pairs of pot and factory. Make sure to specify
/// a correct factory creating an object of the correct type.

/// absolutely necessary. Using it too much may make it harder to
